# Hello react bootstrap

Experiments with https://react-bootstrap.github.io


## Currently...

As of Spetember 2015, React-Bootstrap has most of Bootstrap's components.

But... radio/checkbox groups are still missing:

Although looks like this should be realease in the next month or so...


## To install
```
npm install
```


## To develop
```
npm start
```
This will run the "watch" process, which watches for any changes to the source, and triggers a re-build.

Then open `public/index.html` in your browser.


## To build
```
npm run build
```
Output is in `public/`
